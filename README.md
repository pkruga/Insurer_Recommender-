# Reliability Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict reliability scores based on various factors. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and deployment.

## Project Structure

- **Data:** Contains the raw and preprocessed data files.
- **Notebooks:** Includes Jupyter notebooks for each stage of the project.
- **Models:** Stores the trained predictive models.
- **Deployment:** Contains scripts or files related to model deployment.

## Steps

1. **Load and Preprocess Data:**
   - Load the dataset from the provided source.
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Convert categorical variables using appropriate encoding techniques.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Perform univariate and bivariate analysis to understand data distributions and relationships.
   - Visualize data patterns using histograms, scatter plots, etc.
   - Identify potential predictors of reliability scores.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
   - Consider interactions, polynomial terms, or domain-specific knowledge.

4. **Model Development:**
   - Train and evaluate various regression models, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, ElasticNet, and Stacking Regressor.
   - Use appropriate evaluation metrics like RMSE, R-squared, and MAE.
   - Perform cross-validation to assess model generalization.

5. **Model Selection and Optimization:**
   - Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics and cross-validation results.
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV.

6. **Deployment and Prediction:**
   - Save the trained model using joblib or a similar library.
   - Develop a deployment strategy, either real-time or batch prediction.
   - Implement a prediction function to generate reliability scores for new data.

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required libraries mentioned in the notebooks.
2. **Run Notebooks:** Execute the Jupyter notebooks in the specified order.
3. **Deploy Model:** Follow the deployment instructions to utilize the trained model for predictions.
