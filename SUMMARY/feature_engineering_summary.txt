## Feature Engineering Summary

### Objectives

- Enhance the predictive power of the dataset by creating new features and transforming existing ones.
- Address potential issues like multicollinearity and missing values.

### Key Steps

- **Label Encoding:** Converted categorical variables ('Insurer', 'Reliability_Label') into numerical representations for compatibility with machine learning models.
- **Quarter and Year Extraction:** Extracted quarter and year information from the 'Date' column to capture potential temporal trends.
- **Reliability Score Creation:** Engineered a composite 'Reliability_Score' metric based on weighted combinations of claims payment, declined, and no-claims ratios. This score provides a comprehensive measure of insurer performance.
- **Reliability Score Visualization:** Explored the distribution of the 'Reliability_Score' using histograms and identified top-performing insurers using bar plots.
- **Multicollinearity Assessment:** Conducted Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis to detect and address potential multicollinearity among numerical features.
- **Feature Selection:** Dropped features with high VIF values or limited relevance to the target variable.
- **Data Splitting:** Partitioned the dataset into training and testing sets to facilitate model evaluation.
- **Normalization and Scaling:** Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler to ensure consistent scaling across variables.
- **Missing Value Imputation:** Employed SimpleImputer to handle missing values by replacing them with the mean of the respective features.

### Outcomes

- The dataset is now enriched with engineered features that capture relevant information for predicting insurer reliability.
- Potential issues like multicollinearity and missing values have been addressed, improving the dataset's suitability for modeling.
- The normalized and imputed features are ready for use in training machine learning models.

### Next Steps

- Proceed with model selection, training, and evaluation using the preprocessed dataset.
- Consider further feature engineering techniques based on model performance and domain knowledge.
