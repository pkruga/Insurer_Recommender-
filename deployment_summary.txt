## Deployment Summary

In this final step, we focused on deploying the chosen Elastic Net for practical use. The model was saved using joblib, enabling easy loading and utilization for predictions.

This deployment strategy allows for:

- **Efficient Predictions:** The saved model can be readily loaded to generate predictions on new data, either in real-time or batch mode.
- **Scalability:** The deployment can be scaled based on the volume of prediction requests, ensuring timely responses.
- **Integration:** The deployed model can be integrated into existing systems or applications, providing seamless access to reliability score predictions.

By successfully deploying the XGBoost model, we have empowered stakeholders to leverage the model's predictive capabilities for informed decision-making and proactive reliability management.
