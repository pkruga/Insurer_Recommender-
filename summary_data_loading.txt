## Data Loading and Cleaning Summary

### 1. Data Loading:

- The dataset was successfully loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
- Initial inspection revealed the presence of both numerical and categorical features.

### 2. Data Cleaning:

- **Data Type Conversion:**
    - Numeric columns (starting from the third column) were converted to float.
    - The 'Date' column was converted to datetime format.
- **Handling Duplicates:**
    - No duplicate rows were found in the dataset.
- **Insurer Name Standardization:**
    - Variations in insurer names were identified and replaced with consistent naming conventions.
    - Entries related to the defunct 'Resolution Insurance Company' were removed.
- **Removal of Industry Totals:**
    - Rows representing industry totals were identified and removed.
    - Rows with dates in the year 1970 were also removed.
- **Outlier Handling:**
    - Numerical columns were analyzed for outliers using box plots.
    - Ratio columns ('Claims_declined_ratio_(%)', 'Claims_closed_as_no_claims_ratio (%)', 'Claim_payment_ratio_(%)') were capped at 100% to address unrealistic values.

### 3. Final Dataset:

- The cleaned dataset is now free of duplicates, inconsistencies in insurer names, industry totals, and unrealistic ratio values.
- The dataset has been saved as 'cleaned_data.csv'.

### Next Steps:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) can now be performed on the cleaned dataset to gain insights and inform further modeling decisions.
